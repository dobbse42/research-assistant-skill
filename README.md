## About
This is intended to be a voice assistant for reading academic papers. long-term, this is ideally integrated with some sort of mobile platform, but short-term it will be desktop-only. this was originally designed as a mycroft skill, and so the below notes treat it as such:

## Examples
* "Mycroft, what new papers came out today?"
* "List new papers"
* "Let's read the next paper in my reading list"
* "Read a paper"
* "Read the latest issue of quantum"
* "Let's go through today's papers"
* "Let's check archive"
* "Mycroft, let's read some papers"
* "Mycroft, read me a paper"
